    ## Upgrade

    Please follow the steps outlined in the [upgrade guide](https://headscale.net/stable/setup/upgrade/) to update your existing Headscale installation.

    **It's best to update from one stable version to the next** (e.g., 0.24.0 → 0.25.1 → 0.26.1) in case you are multiple releases behind. You should always pick the latest available patch release.

    Be sure to check the changelog above for version-specific upgrade instructions and breaking changes.

    ### Backup Your Database

    **Always backup your database before upgrading.** Here's how to backup a SQLite database:

    ```bash
    # Stop headscale
    systemctl stop headscale

    # Backup sqlite database
    cp /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite.backup

    # Backup sqlite WAL/SHM files (if they exist)
    cp /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite-wal /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite-wal.backup
    cp /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite-shm /var/lib/headscale/db.sqlite-shm.backup

    # Start headscale (migration will run automatically)
    systemctl start headscale
    ```

      Open source implementation of the Tailscale control server.
      Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
      Tailscale control server. Headscale's goal is to provide self-hosters and
      hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for their projects and
      labs. It implements a narrow scope, a single Tailscale network (tailnet),
      suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source organisation.
